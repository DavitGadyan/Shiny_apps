"1","Industry remains the basis of Armenian Economy this is evidenced by the fact that realization of the industrial growth active policy plays an important role in the Presidents preelection program as well of RA Government programs The RA Government driven by the imperative to increase the competitiveness of the economy and ensure continuous economic growth has adopted the policy of building knowledgebased economy and implementing exportbased industrial policy The industrial policy is based on the expansion of exportable sectors of economy by contributing to the development of sectors with export potential emphasizing the development of processing industry The Ministry of Economy is constantly carrying out activities towards development and implementation of the policy of overall industry as well as of its separate sectors which mainly aims to transform Armenia to industrially developed country with the use of modern management models and competitive technologies as well as through constant development of human capital For the implementation of the above mentioned objectives The Strategy of ExportLed Industrial Policy of RA has been developed by the Ministry which has been approved by RA Government on December   The document aims to set out and develop new areas of economic growth together with continuous development of existing exporting sectors and those with export potential  sectors have been indicated in the document as ones with significant export potential  sector specific strategies are being developed brandy manufacturing pharmaceuticals and biotechnologies precision engineering sectors strategies and are currently in the discussion process with relevant representatives of the sectors and state bodies The industrial sector of Armenia is one of economys main branches estimating around  of GDP in  and  of total employment  organizations Armenia has great potential for branchy industry where main sectors such as food industry light industry mining and metallurgical chemical and pharmaceutical biotechnological engineering and electrical tool making and electrotechnical industry jewellery and building materials production are presented Armenian industrial enterprises succeeded to overcome the global financial crisis proving their important role in the economy Industrial sectors ensuring high growth rates are mining industry metallurgy food industry pharmacy clothing manufacturing jewellery etc Recent economic decline caused by the global economic crisis has the stressed the necessity of deepening the economic diversification In this regard Ministry of Economy highlights integrated development of industrial sectors and exportable sectors primarily Investment including foreign has impacted the competitive production expansion and new enterprises have been set up representing different sectors particularly Elbatproduction of battery Saranistproduction of glass containers Shamb Businessfood industry Akhtamartourism Ucomtelecommunications Arpimed and Liqvorpharmacy sectors State support tools In order to mitigate the impact of the global financial crisis on the economy to create favorable conditions for the development of industrial sectors to promote local production and to create new jobs the RA Government applies complex tools of state support aimed to increase export and import substitution by creating favorable conditions for new investments The RA Law on Making Amendments in the RA Law on Value Added Tax adopted by the National Assembly of RA in April  is among the abovementioned tools The latter gives opportunity to delay VAT payment terms up to  years in the framework of investments projects exceeding  billion AMD and more Legislative changes contributed to the large flow of investments and as a result of programs implementation new productions and new jobs were created To date many organizations from various sectors of the economy have received tax privileges The total amount of investments anticipated by the projects approved by RA Government is about  billion AMD delayed VAT amounts  billion AMD Thanks to investments about  new jobs are already created and as a result of the above mentioned projects implementations total employment will be up to  Another effective tool for promoting investment is RA Law On Amendment of the RA Customs Code developed by the Ministry of Economy of RA and adopted by the National Assembly in December  The aim of the amendment was to simplify the procedure of terms extension for import of machinery and equipment imported for industrial purposes and provide state support to the implementation of investment projects approved by RA Government To ensure Law enactment the Ministry of Economy has developed a new regulation on extension of terms of goods importedexported by Temporary importTemporary export customs regime which was adopted by RA Government N N Decree on August   For the implementation of  investment projects the RA Government on the proposal of the Ministry of Economy has already provided tax privileges to a number of organizations For increasing access to credit resources for industry sector and for attracting finance the Ministry of Economy has developed the regulation of running registration of machine tools equipments and their component parts subject to inventory in RA The regulation was approved by RA Government N N Decree on April   Source MFA of the Republic of Armenia",2010
"2","Armenia relies on a diverse mix of energy resources and renewables present a range of challenges strategic advantages and market opportunities In  alone the World Bank announced an investment of  million to assess sites with geothermal potential and Armenbrok OJSC announced an initial public offering to raise  million to construct three hydropower plants in NagornoKarabagh  Nuclear power natural gas and hydropower have been analyzed to a large extent so this analysis is focused on the market opportunities and strategic advantages of solar and wind in the context of Armenias overall energy situation  Domestic fuel resources are hydropower nuclear power wind power fuelwood and solar and geothermal power while natural gas consumed in the energy and other sectors is imported from Russia In   percent of the energy consumed was generated by the Medzamor Nuclear Power Plant  percent was produced by hydropower and wind and  percent was generated by thermal power plants fueled by imported natural gas and coal  Armenia does not have any significant domestic fossil fuel reserves so the natural gas for the thermal power plants and Armenias gaspowered vehicles is imported via pipeline through Georgia The supply has been disrupted for political and economic reasons over the past  years but there is a new pipeline under construction in the south which is expected to open up an alternative source of gas from Iran Medzamor NPP is an important part of the countrys energy system although the plant is scheduled to shut down in  The European Union and United States have pressured Armenia to close the plant but the government has refused over energy security concerns In fact the government issued a tender in  for a new plant that would likely be a safer third generation design In the meantime Armenia imports nuclear fuel from Russia so energy is dependent on the cost of uranium and natural gas which may fluctuate according to economic and geopolitical factors in the region The basic principles of the Energy Sector Development Strategy adopted by the government in  are achieving sustainable economic development enhancing energy independence and ensuring efficient use of domestic and alternative sources of energy Overall the energy security plan is based on renewables and conservation nuclear energy and diversification of supplies The analysis of Armenias energy situation is done at the national level and accounts for power plant production but it rarely factors the use of fuelwood for heating and cooking among the population which is quite common A national survey conducted by the Turpanjian Center for Policy Analysis in  revealed that  percent of the population uses fuelwood for heating or cooking This is significant since a study published in International Forestry Review reported only eight percent forest cover so a comprehensive energy strategy should address sustainable forestry In addition to the absence of domestic fossil fuel supplies and subsequent reliance on imported fuel that fluctuates in price and availability the driving factor behind Armenias energy policy is an understanding that as economic development advances there will be increasing demand for energy Armenias GDP has grown at an average of  percent over the last several years and energy demand will increase as the population becomes more affluent and urbanized Therefore a proactive policy is a positive step to ensure that efficiency and renewable technologies are an integral part of the energy mix Solar Market Potential Armenia began thinking about energy independence after the  earthquake when Kenell Touryan was approached at the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Colorado about the potential for bringing renewable energy to Armenia Yerevan State University and the State Engineering University of Armenia have been working on photovoltaic PV cells for  years a Solar Institute was working on wind and solar hot water and Armenia had experience with wind turbine assembly according to Dr Kenell Touryan who is now vice president of research and development at the American University of Armenia As part of a nonproliferation program the US Department of Energy funded research by former Soviet weapons specialists in the s to do research and development in renewable energy that could be commercialized Currently SunEnergy LLC and SolarEn LLC are selling solar thermal units for buildings the Viasphere Technopark is working on a PV tracking system the State Engineering University of Armenia is working on a PV cell coating technology and a Californiabased company is funding research to manufacture its PV system in Armenia according to Touryan Dr Artak Hambarian who is associate director of the Engineering Research Center began working on a rooftop solar monitoring station at AUA in  and a Solar Driven Desiccant Cooling Demonstration System DESODEC was designed and installed soon after The project involved the collaboration of scientists from Portugal Germany Russia and Armenia The  kW solar hot water project got SolarEn LLC started building its own panels and it uses a desiccant cooling system to cool a seat auditorium in the summer Desiccant cooling has been in use since the s but the unique thing about this installation is that a  kW PV system provides the necessary electricity  In this system the air is pumped through a chamber of several desiccant wheels which use a gel to remove humidity and have the capacity to lower air temperature from  degrees to  degrees F It is more efficient and comparable in cost to a chiller system emphasizes Hambarian The twowing PV array relies on eight batteries that are each six volts to store power and the roof support structure spans across three rooftops using a structure that is flexible for earthquake protection Currently the largest array in Armenia the PV system was installed in  and it produces just over  kW of power from  watt panels The panels were manufactured by experts from the State Engineering University and American University of Armenia A  market study by Danish Energy Management indicates that Armenia has proven experience in PV technologies and significant deposits of raw materials for developing a local technological chain This extensive study coauthored by SolarEn LLC points out that the existence of a wide variety of siliceous raw material of various types and morphology local experience in PV technologies and a highly competitive research and development potential give Armenia a comparative advantage in this sector From the various PV technologies analyzed a few can be considered ready and some of those can be applicable for PV industry development in Armenia Technological chains based on local raw materials and existing infrastructure can offer a certain degree of competitive advantage for investors Today in Armenia a number of companies and organization exist that can help jumpstart the PV industry development notes the report optimistically Wind Market Potential The National Renewable Energy Laboratory developed a map of wind power resources for Armenia in  in collaboration with SolarEn LLC This analysis assesses a wind power potential of  MW from seven sites that cover an area of  sq km This corresponds to an area of three percent of the territory of Armenia that is limited to remote mountainous passes at an elevation of  m or higher Armenias Energy Sector Development Strategy of  includes a series of renewable targets to reach by  that include  MW of hydropower  MW of wind and  MW of geothermal The Energy Law of the Republic of Armenia also guarantees the purchase of  percent of electricity generated from renewable energy sources including wind from licensed entities for  yearsAn analysis by Ara Marjanyan estimates that the addition of  MW of gridconnected wind power to achieve the national goal by  would require an investment of US million to  billion According to Dr Vardan Sargsyan of the State University of Economics the economically viable capacity for wind energy is comparable with nuclear in Armenia During a  NATO conference in Istanbul on energy sustainable development and environmental security Sargsyan indicated that the government is planning to generate  percent of its electricity from wind power by  and that several prospective sites have been identified In  the first in wind farm in the South Caucasus was put into operation at Pushkin Pass in northern Armenia The total installed capacity of the farm is  MW and the Lori  project comprises four  kW Vestas wind turbines The wind farm was funded by a  million grant from the government of Iran which is also working on a natural gas pipeline and hydropower station along the border of the two countries Negotiations are underway with international investors to expand the Lori  wind farm at Pushkin Pass The project was initiated in  with the support of the Ministry of Economy of the Netherlands and the total installed capacity was intended to be  MW using  turbines with  kW of rated power and a total anticipated cost of  million Dr Ara Marjanyan who is the Renewable Energy Project coordinator of the Armenia Renewable Resources and Energy Efficiency Fund outlined a series of outstanding financial and policy issues that are necessary for Armenia to achieve its renewable energy targets for wind First consistent with the tariff procedure for small hydropower wind tariffs should be fixed so developers can perform project feasibility analyses for a typical project life span of  years Second the initial costs of wind power projects may be reduced by lowering the burden of the value added tax VAT on imported equipment for renewable energy projects since there is no local manufacturing of modern wind turbines in Armenia Currently the cost of wind turbines are approximately  percent of the total initial cost of a wind project and the VAT in Armenia would subject this to a  percent tax According to Touryan there is a high level of international interest in investing in wind power projects in Armenia and he cites proposals from Germany England Sweden Italy and Greece who are investigating claims to the top rated sites for wind power potential The government is interested and there are trained engineers that can work on it states Touryan who added that they are discussing incentive programs with the government to finance wind and other renewable energy programs Conclusions Given Armenias lack of fossil fuel reserves and its economic and geopolitical circumstances its national leadership seems to appreciate the importance of the renewable energy sector and has adopted an Energy Sector Development Strategy in the Context of Economic Development in Armenia The underlying principle is the understanding that as the country develops and the standard of living improves the economy will become more energy intensive even while pursuing energy efficiency measures As studies in solar and wind power demonstrate there is a high level of scientific expertise in the country that has already been working on renewable energy technologies Currently organizations such as the Armenia Renewable Resources and Energy Efficiency Fund RE are developing feasibility studies and offering preferential financing in a revolving loan fund to attract investors in this sector according to RE director Tamara Babayan At the same time experts are working to improve the regulatory and economic conditions to nurture the development of the renewable energy sector through tax incentives reviews of tariff structures and methods and legislation that demonstrates a commitment on the part of the government to incorporate clean technology into the energy system Already Armenia uses renewables to a large extent primarily with hydropower that meets  percent of the countrys electricity needs While wind is competitive in the US with power from traditional sources of fuel in Armenia hydropower is competitive because it benefits from existing tax and tariff incentives Solar and wind power are at an earlier stage of development than hydropower and it is likely that similar incentives will be made available to project developers in these sectors Research and development in solar technology is at an advanced stage and the current goal is to create a manufacturing infrastructure for domestic consumption and an export industry for PV panels Wind is at an earlier stage of development since there is not much local experience operating or building large wind farms although the NREL wind resource assessment indicates the availability of adequate wind resources that could make a project profitable if the government responds to industry recommendations on tax and tariff barriers Since Armenia is a landlocked country facing difficult geopolitical circumstances there are challenges for transportation and market access However the Armenian Diaspora has been proactive in its leadership in the high tech field and industry leaders in the renewable energy field are attempting to introduce their products in Armenia and nurture new industry development This has been welcome because it will create jobs in a country where there is still widespread poverty and underemployment Ultimately the renewable energy sector can help Armenia achieve its energy independence and sustainable development goals while at the same time emerging as a global leader in the clean energy sector Acknowledgements The author

"9"," There is no shortage of recent success stories about national economies skipping the development of a large manufacturing sector and instead building a prosperous economy on a robust services industry alone Countries like Ireland Norway and India have largely forgone manufacturing and instead focused their economies on services the sector of the economy that includes things like finance software development design IT media customer support and other services that are increasingly becoming easier to trade in thanks to technology The traditional view of an economys services sector is a negative one it is frequently accused of being unproductive and not valuable to an economys international competitiveness This may have been true in the recent past services have traditionally been immobile and involved only in the domestic economy contributing little to a countrys exports However with the emergence of better communications technology the traditional barriers to exporting services have waned India and Ireland have been able to capitalize on this opportunity and have built successful export economies based largely on services attracting massive foreign investment and trade The traditional meat and potatoes of an economy has always been thought to be the manufacturing sector Development economists still preach the triedandtrue methods of moving labor from agriculture to highproductivity manufacturing jobs This is undoubtedly how economies have developed in the past see South Korea Taiwan or China as recent examples But the outlook on manufacturing is not as rosy for Armenia Sure Armenia was a manufacturing powerhouse in the Soviet Union but without the protection of the centrally planned economy Armenia is in a whole new ball game In the new economic climate that Armenia finds itself in  with no sea ports of its own eastern and western blockades and an underdeveloped infrastructure  the manufacturing industry faces many obstacles Meanwhile a potentially strong services sector has many opportunities to look toward providing new hope at least for the near future Since independence Armenias services sector has overtaken its manufacturing And in the s the services sector has been the clear driving force behind Armenias high economic growth rates As a portion of GDP Armenias services sector holds  percent while it employs  percent of the labor force One needs only to cruise down an avenue in Yerevan driving carefully of course to see evidence of this advertisements for VivaCellMTS Ameriabank and other such service corporations litter the city There are a number of reasons why a servicesoriented economy offers better prospects for Armenia For one services  which are largely based on telecommunications and which lack the need for physical transportation of goods  can bypass Armenias troubles with infrastructure and its lack of sufficiently accessible trade and transportation routes A services industry also circumvents the need for a lowwage exploitable labor force that is necessary in most newly industrializing economies Armenia does not possess nor should it want such a labor force  Services jobs provide far better working conditions The services industry is also a boon when it comes to opportunities for women Services jobs are equally accessible if not more accessible to women as they are to men Increased opportunities for women means not only greater social equality but also increased incomes for households Lastly services have far less impact on the environment This is a very attractive offer to Armenia which suffers its fair share of environmental degradation and problems arising from it  Servicebased is the industry that the global economy is shifting towards with more room to grow than other industries and a plethora of new opportunities that wellprepared countries can seize Considering that most of Armenias current manufacturing sector consists of raw commodities exports and not much highvalue production equipping itself to reap the benefits of favorable services opportunities is the most sensible thing Armenia can do If Armenia were to embrace services it would have no lack of useful resources Armenia has an enthusiastic diaspora who are educated and possess skills and knowledge about the services industry that they can introduce to Armenia not to mention the capital with which to start such business ventures  Armenia also has a capable workforce for the services with decent education good technical knowledge and plenty of artistic skills The only thing missing from the Armenian labor force is an Englishspeaking workforce a vital component to any service economy Of course it might be grossly overoptimistic to hope that Armenia with its scores of growthinhibiting problems such as corruption and an oligopolistic economy is actually prepared to take on this challenge But there are a number of things the Armenian government can do to create a more competitive services sector  The most important task would be to invest more in education especially in technical skills An ideal decision also would be to replace Russian language learning courses in school with English The Armenian government should also invest in services infrastructure further improving and upgrading telecommunications lines for example encouraging more widespread Internet access and establishing helpful regulatory and oversight agencies Many of these needed investments into education and infrastructure have been undertaken by the private sector as business investments as in the case of the massive telecom infrastructure overhaul that has been carried out recently almost exclusively by private companies But the Armenian government should not rely on the benevolence of the private sector or nongovernmental organizations it should resolve to carry out these tasks on its own if it expects to guarantee its goals The most important thing that the Armenian government needs to do however is to overcome its crippling system of oligopolies and to encourage vigorous competition To stay competitive internationally the government must allow the services market to operate freely intervening not to provide favors for governmentconnected pals but to encourage more competitiveness and to protect nascent enterprises On the same token the government must allow the services industry to compete with foreign firms and do business with them only in this way can Armenia bolster the quality of its services exports With help from government an Armenian architecture firm or web development company has the potential to be as large a company as some of its bestknown European counterparts The recent opening of the Tumo Center for Creative Technologies in Yerevan provides hands on education in to youth in a stateoftheart facility  This type of instruction in the fields of animation gaming web development and video will lead to a broadening of career opportunities for our new generation  The AYF with its work in the Youth Corps program and through its donations of computers and books among other efforts can help towards this goal as well supplementing the work needed to prepare for the future of Armenias services industry",2011

 July  Im going to throw all of you in prison
These were the words uttered by tax investigator Rafael Mkrtichyan to Nareg Hartounian a LebaneseArmenian who founded the Naregatsi Art Institute
Yes folks heres yet another story of a diaspora Armenian investor being bullied by officials in Armenia  this time its the dreaded State Revenue Committee
A bit in the way of background info on this family and their activities
The Naregatsi Art Institute was incorporated in  as a nonprofit organization Its stated objective is to serve Armenias existing cultural heritage through supporting Armenian contemporary artists and creating a forum in which the spirit of art and the common voice can resonate freely
The Naregatsi Art Institute opened its doors to the public on September   and in Shushi on August   The Shushi branch was housed in a dilapidated building that was rebuilt Both centers were accessible to the physically disabled To date over  million has been spent on the two art centers wwwnaregatsiorg
With their own resources the Haroutunian family carries out charitable projects in Yerevan Shushi and Karvatchar
They have constructed the Knaravan village north of Karvatchar in the liberated territories and have populated it with homeless families It was named in honor of Knar Haroutunian the familys deceased mother The projects aim was to build houses for The tiny community also has a school and a medical unit so that the  families can be provided with all the necessary living conditions The project costing  was completed in  wwwknaravanorg
During the years  the Haroutunian family has contributed over  million to charitable works in Armenia and Artsakh
In September  Nareg also became director of GH Storage Enterprises a foodstuff importing business started by his father Garabed Haroutunian
Before Nareg took over the reins of GH Storage Enterprises the companys executive director was Sevak Artzruni and Artyom Martirosyan was the managing director Artzruni ran the show and made all the decisions The Haroutunian family lived in the US and had close ties to the Sevak Artzruni family It was Artzruni who ran the business for the Haroutunians
It was the sudden falling out between Nareg Hartounian and Artzruni that prompted the companys warehouse manager to send off a letter to Armenian law enforcement stating that the company was purposefully avoiding paying taxes
The man who wrote the letter was Garik Babayan the brother of Sevak Artzrunis wife Nareg had fired Garik Babayan from his job two weeks after becoming executive director
The Kentron and Nork Marash Administrative Court issued a search warrant for the companys premises The court order said it was to search for goods not duly registered as inventory The court claimed that  million AMD worth of goods were thus concealed out of an import order of  million
The investigator in charge failed to note when such transactions were alleged to have taken place Had he done so it would turn out that it was during the tenure of Sevak Artzruni as executive director
But Im jumping the gun Sevak Artzruni served as the legal representative power of attorney for the Haroutunian family since  He purchased real estate for them
GH Storage Enterprises was established in the name of Garabed Haroutunian and in  he and his two sons Nareg and Saro signed a document obliging them to pay Sevak Artzruni  of their commercial profits derived in Armenia
On September   Sevak Artzruni signed a document forgoing any further dealings with the Haroutunian family and annulling any prior obligations he had to them
In the letter Artzruni cited such factors as a change in the Haroutunians attititude and growing lack of confidence as a reason for his pulling out of any and all contractual arrangements with the family
Artzruni also mentioned that he expected to be paid the  in remuneration for services rendered
Artzruni naturally failed to mention was the fact that Nareg has noticed that large amounts of cash had gone missing He demanded some answers from Artzruni
This is where the story gets more than a bit confusing and multilayered Everyone seems to have gotten involved  the courts cops tax authorities and a host of other characters
In the end Sevak Artzruni sues Garabed Haroutunian and his two sons demanding that the court make them hand over the  profit owed him
Sevak Artzruni walks around Yerevan flanked with bodyguards
When he was the executive director of GH Storage Enterprises Artzruni had the company pay the head of the Police Departments Division of Personal and Property Protection for the bodyguards

"11","The Honourable Mr John A Heffern US Ambassador to Armenia  Honourable Ambassador Heffern My name is Edmond Khudyan a US citizen and the president of Arin Capital  Investment Corp a real estate investmentdevelopment firm in Glendale CA I am also the founder of Arin Capital  Investment LLC a real estate development co in Yerevan Armenia development project known as Mashtotc  I am writing to You hopping that I can bring to your attention and get your diplomatic missions appropriate involvement in an almost  up to date embezzlement case which I filed in November of  with RA State Revenue Committee PEK This organized set of criminal activity in my company has resulted in missing of millions of dollars and defrauding of the RA tax agency by  shareholders of the company   A few months later in March of  I filed several complaints with the RA President and other judicial bodies of the government regarding the embezzlement of  from the company A copy of that complaint was also sent to the former US Ambassador Honourable Marie Yovanovitch and it can be viewed on the web at Hetq Online My complaint described all the illegal activities of Vladislav Mangasaryan and Ghevond Ghaloumyan  shareholderspartners in Arin Capital  Investment LLC and company director Edward Yesayan Based on a set of preliminary findings a criminal case  was initiated on May   Since May   another  worth of assets were swindled from my company and this was done with the direct consent of officials from the Prosecutors Office and the State Revenue Commission In the fall of  it became clear to me that the same group through fabricated judicial acts wanted to seize an additional  worth of assets properties and I immediately notified the appropriate representatives of agencies dealing with criminal case so a freeze could be placed on the property equivalent of a Lis Pendens in the states until a judicial conclusion is reached in this case However those authorities failed to take such measures  baselessly arguing that there was no victim or accused and thus they could not place a freeze In May of  to avoid a similar situation we met with assistant General Prosecutor Mr Mnacakan Sargsyan and Department Director Grigor Hovhannisyan where we obtained their verbal agreement that they would proceed with the freeze if we officially file such a request  However after filing the request again no measures were taken and additional  worth of real estate was seized No words could express our frustration This underhanded act  or better said lack of action  once again proved complete and intentional failure of the abovementioned RA governmental agencies and officials putting corruption front and center as the core reason behind their actions As the evidence of the crime was presented to State Revenue Committee Lead Inspector Tigran Harutyunyan prosecutor Lernik Hovhannisyan department director Grigor Hovhannisyan assistant to the prosecutor general Mnatsakan Sargsyan and prosecutor general Aghvan Hovespyan all of whom failed to recognize me as a victim and as such prevented me from defending my interests My civil rights have been violated Under the sponsorship of the abovementioned officials the criminals were permitted to continue seize properties Yes the crime is being deliberately buried and justice is not being served Criminals go unpunished and continue to conduct sales of the units in the building with no regard for the companys rightful owners interests This is corruption reigning supreme in Armenia We are dealing with a well organized criminal group which knows how to commit crime and steal operating thought high ranking officials and their family members who have the power to influence and obtain favourable court decisions and avoid prosecution The Prosecutors office and State Revenue Committee officials are well aware of this groups identity their criminal profile their criminal activities causing the fraudulent unpaid taxes and the crime committed but they are unwilling to do anything about it The prosecutors office has sheltered this group and allowed them to seize the few last properties belonging to Diaspora Armenians  The US Embassy staff members have periodically been present at my trials They too have certain details at their disposal I would kindly ask that you instruct your staff members to follow the conduct of RA legal agencies and the manner of their operations Please also be informed that steps are being taken to relocate this trial to the United States and file a legal suit against the Republic of Armenia according to the ICSID Convention International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes UNICITIRAL arbitration rules the USARA Investment Agreement andor the RA Law on Compensation for Losses Incurred by Foreign Investors Considering that the Armenian judicial system does not seem to be working and I have been left powerless to defend myself and my interests I hope to have US Embassys active followup and oversight of my ongoing judicial struggle against all parties involved including the RA agencies and officials A court trial about this case is scheduled for Monday Oct th at am and I would appreciate if Embassys staff members can be present   Information articles and press conferences about this case can be viewed at arincapitalcom  Respectfully Edmond Khudyan USA

"19","US Democratic National Committee Reddit KAYWEB and KAYWEB Angels Granatus Ventures Its not the first time that GNCAlfa changes the game rules on the Armenian Internet market The first time the company has significantly improved the wholesale Internet market by its entrance in  building communication networks in Georgia and Iran and offering unprecedentedly low prices for wholesale Internet in Armenia The company has quickly occupied a steady place on the market and today as its leadership claims occupies over  of the wholesale Internet market of Armenia The next time the company has changed the rules of the game was in December  when GNCAlfa began providing retail Internet services not in Yerevan but in countrys regions under Rostelecom brand But GNCAlfa differs from other large Armenian operators also because the companys head office is situated not in the capital but in the city of Abovyan The building of the company and the large number of cars parked in front of it look a little bit unusual against the dozing background of the city but anyhow it proves that in our country its possible to conduct an effective business not only in Yerevan GNCAlfa CEO Hayk Faramazyan told iTelam how to do it Mr Faramazyan let me congratulate you on Rostelecoms entrance to the Armenian retail Internet market We havent had a chance to talk about yet  Tell us please how did Rostelecom become interested in an Armenian operator The owners of the company were looking for a strategic investor for the development of companys business As a result we received the best proposal from Rostelecom and the latter acquired  share of the owner of GNCAlfaToday Rostelecom is an absolute leader on the Russian Internet market and occupies over  of the market which exceeds the market share of its nearest competitor about  times The controlling stake in Rostelecom belongs to the Russian Federation but the companys shares are traded on the Stock Exchange as wellI think that just like for all large telecommunication companies Rostelecom as well viewed the expansion beyond national borders as a logical stage of developmentIt should be noted that Armenia is the first market outside Russia for Rostelecom Taking into consideration the strategic partnership between Russia and Armenia and Armenias favorable business climate Rostelecoms decision was quite logicalThus the rebranding of GNCAlfa began in December and we began sales on the retail market in Abovyan Ashtarak and Gyumri The list of cities will be expanded soon The rich experience of Rostelecom on the Russian market is valuable for us both from the point of view of service and range of services Why did you decide to begin from the regions Is it economically effective at this moment or it was done out of longterm interests  Since we have begun our business as a backbone operator and we have a developed network in many cities across Armenia it was decided to start with the regionsWe see quite a big demand in the regions as well as a lack of quality and level of services which are provided in YerevanAs for the investment return it certainly differs from that of the capital but our business plan does consider the capital and the regions separately and we will launch activity in the capital soon Does GNC provide profitability as a backbone operator Yes it does The company was profitable from the very first day of its activity Our sales volumes have been dynamically growing since the very beginning When do you expect profits also on the retail market We plan to achieve profitability within a reasonable period of time but I wont name any deadlines When companies go beyond their national borders the first thing they expect as a rule is a quicker investment return than on the domestic market  Is it the case with Rostelecom Investment return on Armenias telecommunication market resembles the situation in Russias regions It appears that entering the Armenian market Rostelecom receives the same as it would have got in case of expansion in Russia What is the dynamics of client flow Do you already have statistics We have a big number of applications and first subscribers have already been connected Since we are a new operator on the retail market the clients should see the quality of our services We still have much to prove to our clients I believe we will prove that we are one of the best ones or even the best one How does the competition among Internet providers in the regions look like Can we expect you to take a leading place in the regions soon Yes we expect that well cover the market quickly although we have serious competitors in the regions both in terms of retail and wireless InternetI think our target market in the regions will involve new Internet subscribers and not other providers customers who will prefer us Armenia has a huge potential for increasing the number of subscribers and the penetration level has a huge space for growth On the one hand it is conditioned by the absence of access networks bad communication quality as well as insufficient access to computers We are also planning to offer computers to our subscribers at various loan schemes Do the operators focus on apartment buildings or private houses while building a network At this moment our network is being built in apartment buildings But we are planning to cover also private houses in the nearest future At this very moment we conduct a marketing analysis in this direction  You are also planning to enter the digital TV market When will it happen and how will this service differ from existing ones The contentprovider of digital TV will be our partner and we will provide only the infrastructure We have chosen a very good and leading technology that will be applied in Armenia for the first time It is called Over The Top OTT which means broadband delivery of video and audio without the Internet service provider being involved in the control or distribution of the content itself  unlike IPTV through which television services are delivered using the own Internet protocol suite OTT requires  Mbitsec speed authorWe plan to start providing services in the coming two months and provide a large number of interactive services through this system Does GNCAlfa participate in the contest announced by the government for the construction of an elevated digital TV and Radio broadcasting system We do not take part in the contest but our infrastructure can be used as our network is the longest in Armenia and we are open for cooperation GNCAlfa also provides fixed telephone services What advantages does this service have as compared to that of competitors and what is your target market in terms of fixed telephony Just like in case with Internet services we began with the corporate sector This sector is interested in these services and we are trying to find a unique approach to all corporate clientsFixed telephony is urgent also for the regional retail subscribers as this service is affordable and good We think we will succeed on this market too How did your corporate clients benefit including your clients retail Internet providers from the fact that Rostelecom has bought the controlling stock in the company We think that transit services through Georgia and Russia have become much easier and cheaper Prior to buying assets in Armenia Rostelecom has been one of the companies that provided Internet to Armenia for many years Now Rostelecoms services as a supplier of Internet to Armenia have become significantly cheaper Most of Armenian consumers use websites on Russian servers and as the considerable part of this content is on the servers of Rostelecom the quality of communication becomes much better and faster In this regard we have an advantage as we make Internet more qualitative and available How will you assess todays situation on the retail Internet market The market is developing the providers are increasing consumption volumes At the same time there is a tendency of providers expansion which bears witness to the logical development of the market This tendency will continue within the coming  years Does your strategy assume absorption of other players Not today Our company registers successful organic growth starting from provision of pure interoperator services ending with the retail market The companys strategy currently justifies itself and we will continue developing the same way in the futureThe Internet market in Armenia is still in the phase of a dynamic growth and when it reaches such a level of penetration when the growth slows down further development will proceed thanks to the increase of the quality and provision of additional services Today there is a very interesting tendency on the global market today if the telecom operators earlier used to provide a simple pipe and content provision was the matter of the provider today these businesses are mixed with each other For example in some cities of the United States Google has built its own network and vice versa the operators become content providersRuben Harutyunyan talked to Hayk Faramazyan Its

cognac because thats where the investment is being directed Armenian wines also arent well represented on the international market He argues that for the past  years first Russia and then the Soviet Union targeted the best winemaking technologies to Georgia and Bessarabia while Armenia got the nod for cognac This was due to the fact that under Seljuk and Persian rule Armenia had lost a majority of its grape gene pool  the best Armenian vineyards were in the possession of foreign conquerors The Georgians had an independent state in the thth century and made sure their grapes werent destroyed Thus when Armenia was incorporated into Tsarist Russia in  we had grapes that were only suited for vodka production When European technology reached Armenia in  it was quite easy to produce cognac from the grape alcohol Thats exactly what happened says Haroutyunyan Armenia led Tsarist Russia in terms of cognac production Armenians have turned their back on wine preferring vodka The consumption of wine in Armenia has drooped in the last three years after steadily rising since  Consumption hit a peak in  at  million liters Ten years before the number was  million Consumption today averages  million liters   million liters of locally produced wine was consumed in  During the past twelve years foreign wine imports have increased tenfold In terms of per capita consumption the figure is one liter for Armenia In Europe its fifty liters What Armenia needs is a new culture of wine appreciation Armenians have traditionally turned away from drinking wine and thats a dangerous trend Wine especially red wine has proven health benefits Wine is akin to medicine and is a cultural pastime in much of the world Numerous studies have shown that men should drink  grams of dry red wine daily The figure for women is a minimum of  grams Avag Haroutyunyan says The vintner says that the drop in Armenian wine consumption can be linked to emigration and the fact the puzzling trait of Armenians to appreciate foreign goods over local products Today in Armenia there are three or four companies that have reached a high level in terms of quality Armenian wines that today are priced at    AMD are just as good qualitatively as wines in the  Euro range sold overseas but are priced at    AMD when imported to Armenia Haroutyunyan says The wine expert adds that only  of the wines sold on the Armenian market are of reputable quality Haroutyunyan believes its a good thing that Armenians are drinking less vodka The record year for vodka consumption in Armenia during the past twelve years was in  when  million liters of domestic vodka was sold A bit less than that was also imported When you add the consumption of domestic and imported vodkas the per capita figure for Armenia was in the top three globally along with Russia and Moldova Vodka consumption started to drop in  but rose again with the onset of the economic crisis of  Its been falling steadily since  This is true for domestically produced vodka and the cheaper imports Sales of expensive vodkas have remained unchanged We drink vodka due to a lack of state policy We arent a nation of wine drinkers argues Haroutyunyan He blames wine growers for lagging in terms of advertising Armenian wines both locally and internationally Haroutyunyan voices a ray of hope and says that Armenian wine growers have bandied together and have convinced the government to draft an extensive project to promote domestic wine production and exports Two new programs to promote Armenia wines Its a  million AMD public relations project planned for  Armenian wines will get greater exposure at international exhibitions and advertising to improve the image of Armenian wines domestically will take place On January  representatives of the CBI Centre for the Promotion of Imports from Developing Countries an Agency of the Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs met with the largest wine growers here in Armenia The plan is for the CBI to select ten domestic growers who will be allocated  Euros each to promote their product in the European market Haroutyunyan says that Georgian wines are well known internationally due to the investment and professional advice provided by such foreign institutions  of the success in wine growing comes directly from the grape variety All the rest the equipment technology advertising is just supplemental Its the grape itself thats key the history of the land Producing quality wine is a very longterm process It takes a minimum of  years to perfect says Haroutyunyan Armenian indigenous grape varieties decimated He says that Armenia once had a large gene pool of numerous grape varieties a fact that allowed scientists some  years ago to claim that the grape is native to the Armenian Highlands Globally there are  varieties of grapes and  are to be found in the Armenian Highlands Traces of Urartian and preUrartian wine making culture have been found in the vicinity of Lake Van For millennia Armenian villagers have been cultivating grapes sorting out the best varieties out of the thousands that existed Weve ended up in a funny situation When people ask how many grape varieties we have we can only count one or two In other words a constant policy of destroying these grape varieties has been going on Haroutyunyan notes He says that currently there are  grape varieties in western Armenia and that the Turks still havent gotten around to changing the Armenian names of some  There are some  types of wine grapes in Azerbaijan that were introduced by Armenians The reason is that until  in Turkey and  in Tsarist Russia Muslims were not allowed to grow wine grapes He claims that this came about when Islam first spread to the region in the th century AD During the Soviet era new grape varieties were selected for Armenia that were supposed to reflect Soviet policy They were designed to be of poor quality but provide bumper harvests After the collapse of the Soviet Union the vineyards of both the old and new varieties fell into disuse We had  indigenous varieties of grape Today we dont know what we have left of those  Perhaps a mere  have been preserved We dont understand the language of those  Now we are only working with the Areni and Kakheti red grapes and  whites What we have to do is select  of the best indigenous varieties and work with them to cultivate them in order to show the world our uniqueness These varieties can only be found in Armenia Today we have serious competition from Georgia Turkey and Azerbaijan They are claiming those varieties for themselves says Haroutyunyan The vintner believes that Armenia is travelling down a dangerous road by importing grape varieties from aboard and growing them This approach spells doom for Armenia Haroutyunyan says The old vineyards in Armenia are falling prey to the phylloxera and other pest related blights  of the vineyards in Armenian belong to local villagers who dont have the resources to restore them The youngest vineyards were planted in the s and in ten years theyll disappear When people mention Areni they believe its a blend of  varieties In fact there are only  or  hectares of the Areni grape in cultivation There are plans to increase the acreage of vineyards by another  hectares But what grape varieties will be planted remains a mystery says Haroutyunyan",2013

organized by Armenpress News Agency made the first stop at Dilijan International School The goal was not only to display that with UWC Dilijan Armenia is due to occupy a specific place on the educational world map but also to make the representatives of other countries retainers of the project based on the advanced philosophy  The Head of Armenpress News Agency Aram Ananyan believes that UWC Dilijan will unite many peoples representatives in Armenia Its also a positive contagious idea which creates a very good image and reputation for the state where the idea comes true In the modern world the societies that manage to find their role in the world built not today but decades later have future and high reputation Good education quality of education and formation of a generation of such professionals that can constantly develop that is vital for Armenia  said Aram Ananyan  The General Director of Bulgarias national news agency BTA Maxim Minchev describes the school as not for tomorrow but the day after tomorrow project It will bring change in thinking and ideology To be honest I am jealous because such projects are necessary for all the countries We have entered a new era Everything is changing the professions too and the kids who will study here will render these changes to the world Armenia may become a wonderful example in this regard because being a small and poor country it has managed to find the right way and introduces to the world a project really full of ideas  he said  Romanian Agerpress Agency Director Alex Giboin was especially drawn to the fact that the school is built on the basis of national ideology Even the stone used is from the local region and thus they try to create an international school with national ideas and symbols  he said  In a conversation with Armenpress the International Relations Manager of Bulgarias State Agency Zlatna Kostova confesses that it is the first time she sees a school like this Prior to this she was admired by the American College of Bulgaria but UWC Dilijan was beyond all expectations She promises to tell all her friends about the Dilijan school and to recommend them to continue their education in Armenia I am really surprised and deeply impressed with the talent of the young team with the idea that guides them to the heights This is an idea which is aimed for the future for the youth and I hope that it will be successful  said Kostova adding that she is particularly attracted by the schools architecture design and colors  After the two years of construction work this year in September UWC Dilijan will start its activities At the moment the last finishing works are being done In order to be able to finish the project by August the construction group works in shifts More than  builders work day and night to create the best conditions for education and development for the children from different countries This year the school has enrolled  pupils Pupils from a dozen of states will receive here the best education and wonderful conditions Among them there are several Georgians  This fact has mostly inspired Georgias State Agency Director Gosha Mirtskhulava They will be friends of Armenia Armenias ambassadors around the world and I think this is a wonderful investment the result of which will be these children  said Mirtskhulava  Professors from the best colleges of the world will teach at the school As the education will be made on the basis of the International Baccalaureate the lecturers must have the relevant IB qualification Initially only foreign specialists will teach at school but in parallel appropriate training will also be held for the Armenian teachers so that they also have the appropriate qualification and later be able to teach at school  Edgar Manukyan responsible for the school project implementation believes that this project is to live for centuries and will leave its imprint When we started this project for Dilijan and Armenia everyone thought that the school should be closed in a closed area but the schools ideology is that it is a part of the society and is open to all Today discussions on cooperation are already under way with the other schools in Dilijan  The school is open to everyone There will be special hours when the children can use the playground swimming pool basketball and football fields get in touch with the students of the school  said Edgar Manukyan  adding that next year the school will enroll as many as  children  By the end of  Dilijan International School became a member of the United World Colleges UWC educational network UWC Dilijan is a largescale charity initiative that will introduce the educational institutions of Armenia on the map of the global education in a new way

"24","The Armenian Weekly March  MagazineArmenias Foreign Policy in Focus Armenia has since the rebirth of her independent state in  pursued a forwardleaning policy to strengthen ties with the United States and NATO Unfortunately Armenias outreach and initiatives to bolster support and investment from the United States have largely not been reciprocated by the Obama Administration Strengthening ties with NATO Armenia has been a member of NATOs Partnership for Peace program since  and currently has troops stationed as part of NATO forces in Afghanistan and Kosovo Armenia also supported USled efforts in the Iraq war In June  as countries were pulling out of Afghanistan Armenia actually tripled its troop deployment there Armenia has  times more troops in Afghanistan per capita than Turkey and  times more per capita than either Canada or France In February of this year Armenia pledged to keep its military contingent in Afghanistan even after NATOs mission is concluded in order to support the USled alliance to train and assist the Afghan army Armenian Defense Minister Seyran Ohanian stated that Armenia is committed to continuous contribution to coalition efforts to establish lasting security in Afghanistan Despite regional pressures related to Armenias relationship with NATO Armenias First Deputy Defense Minister Davit Tonoyan during a visit from US Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Evelyn Farkas in December  explained that joining one or another economic bloc does not inhibit Armenia On the contrary our defense cooperation with the United States will develop and deepen further Farkas in turn thanked Armenia for being a net exporter of security and noted that Armenia is a significant partner to the United States in many ways It is important to note that after the  GeorgianRussian war Armenia was the first country to host NATO exercises in the Caucasus Armenia announced then that it was going to increase its ties with NATO and it has done so ever since Remaining an actor in the protocols farce Perhaps the USs most significant initiative in the region has been its effort to end Turkeys blockade of Armenia through the protocols The protocols provided President Barack Obama the cover he needed to dodge his pledge to end US complicity in Armenian Genocide denial It was the excuse he used in his first April th statement to not recognize the genocide even though he assured Armenian Americans that his view of that history has not changed Although there was strong opposition to the protocols within both Armenia and the diaspora Armenian President Serge Sarkisian has continued to support this USled initiative even though Turkey made it clear within a day of its signing that it had no intention of abiding by the agreement Now more than four years later Armenia still has not withdrawn its signature from the protocolsthis despite the fact that they are being used by Ankara to undermine legitimate Armenian claims and have helped forces who wish to turn the Armenian Genocide from a crime to be internationally condemned into a simple bilateral disagreement between Turkey and Armenia The protocols have helped shield Turkey from outside pressure concerning the Armenian Genocide As a result Turkey has taken an even more aggressive posture against Armenia including more vocally supporting Azerbaijans antiArmenian policies threatening to deport Armenians in Turkey accusing Armenia of committing atrocitiesallegedly the greatest tragedy of the th centuryin the Karabagh War and demolishing a statue to ArmenianTurkish friendship all of which have happened since the protocols were signed Despite Turkey making a mockery of the process and the USs unwillingness to pressure Turkey beyond the occasional empty rhetoric that the ball is in Turkeys court Armenia continues to keep its signature on the protocols Armenia has made it clear that it has done so out of deference to foreign powers such as the United States What has been the US response Armenia is small in size but big in terms of Americas strategic interests in the world It sits in the middle of Washingtons top foreign policy prioritiesIran Russia Turkey Azerbaijan and Syriawhere it can play an important role Although the second largest US embassy in the world sits not in Baghdad or Berlin but in Yerevan the United States does not have much to show for its efforts to promote trade or investment or reciprocate Armenias efforts to strengthen the partnership Its signature diplomatic initiative in Armenia was the protocols which garnered the intense attention of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and President Obama before Armenia and Turkey agreed to sign the accord Since Turkey quickly made it clear that it was not going to abide by that agreement the United States willingness to pour political capital into realizing the agreement dramatically decreased The US has not made Turkey pay a price for its failure to ratify the protocols and end its blockade Instead it has rewarded Turkey by publicly saying it could have a role to play in the Karabakh peace process whereas previous administrations made it clear that Turkey would only have a negative impact on the peace process For instance in November  at a joint press conference with Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu Secretary of State John Kerry discussed consultations with Turkey over NagornoKarabagh without even mentioning the protocols or Turkeys need to end its blockade of Armenia Davutoglu felt comfortable claiming Today I am happy to see that John and me and Turkey and the United States look to NagornoKarabagh from the same perspective Not only did President Obama fail to honor his pledge to recognize the Armenian Genocide but his former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton questioned the veracity of the Armenian Genocidea move no other former Secretary of State in recent memory has made In addition Obamas Solicitor General filed a brief in opposition to a California statute that allowed for Armenian Genocideera property claims to be brought in US courts The Supreme Court refused to hear the case and the California law was struck down denying justice to Armenian Americans Even on issues that would not risk the unreasonable wrath of Turkey and even though numerous Members of Congress and US corporations such as Microsoft NASDAQ and Fed Ex have urged the administration to immediately negotiate a Trade and Investment Framework Agreement TIFA with Armenia the Obama Administration hasnt pursued US interests in promoting trade with Armenia After a near continuous four years of Armenia extending its hand towards NATO and continuing to support the failed USbacked protocols with Turkey Armenian Americans cannot point to any meaningful benefit to USArmenia relations or trade In fact as the examples above illustrate there were actually steps that undermined a strengthening of the partnership What did it seems finally get the attention of the Obama Administration was not Armenias continued support for the protocols and other US policies but rather Armenias decision to move toward Russias Customs Union Soon after the United States announced an over  million investment by the US firm ContourGlobal in hydroelectric power plants in Armenia The announcement of a major US investment in Armenia is a welcome first step in promoting greater USArmenia ties Despite the many regional challenges most notably the hostile neighbors it faces in both Turkey and Azerbaijan Armenia is determined to strengthen its ties with the United States and Europe The United States should do more to strengthen this partnership Doing so will provide the United States with greater options to pursue its interests and promote stability in a geostrategic region Moreover the Obama Administration should stop compromising our values as a country to placate the most radical elements in Turkey especially when it concerns confronting Turkeys statesponsored denial of the Armenian Genocide which is at the root of instability between Turkey Armenia and Azerbaijan As Americans we are in our relations with Armenia and all nations at our best when we align

"30","Established in  Granatus Ventures is the first venture capital firm in Armenia Granatus provides investment expertise and networks to startups worldwide that leverage Armenias potential as an emerging technology hub The venture capital firm has offices in Yerevan London and Singapore Pierre Hennes of Armenian descent is CoFounder and Partner at Granatus Ventures He has extensive experience in investment and new venture creation across Asia Europe and the US and has established and managed several VC firms and startups across multiple sectors over the past  yearsItelam spoke with Pierre Hennes who was in Armenia recently Before establishing Granatus Ventures you had founded three such venture capital firms in Singapore What made you think there was need for such a firm in Armenia I have been living in Singapore for about  years and had moved there as an angel investor  Singapore is an amazing place  it is commited to developing the local startup ecosystem and has invested more than USD  billion in research innovation and enterprise development schemes over the past  yearsMy partners and I saw this as a great opportunity to formalize and scale our investment activities and so we decided to raise formal VC funds targeting investments in Singapore  Asian startups One of our VC funds was established with a significant investment from the Singapore GovernmentArmenia also has great potential for innovation and enterprise and with the support of the World Bank the Government has started a comprehensive program to develop the local ecosystem Israel and Singapore have already successfully implemented similar programs For example the concept of matching grants has also been adopted in Armenia through the Enterprise Incubator Foundation EIF We decided to take a bigger step Thats when my partners and I saw the need and the opportunity to establish the first VC fund in Armenia to invest in local startupsGranatus was launched in October  What strides have you made so far VC funds typically go through three development phases The first phase focuses on fund formation and fundraising which lasts around two years Once the fund is formally launched the investment period begins During this period which typically lasts four years the management team is focused on building the investment portfolio by investing in promising companies as per the funds mandate The final phase or the harvest period lasts four to six years and is the phase that focuses on building value across the portfolio and exiting investments through acquisitions or IPOs Photo MediamaxGranatus is currently in the investment period and has invested in eight startups Those either locally registered companies or companies having core value add activities in Armenia More than  high quality engineers are employed in Armenia across all companies in our portfolio Some of our companies are already in the process of completing second round financing By the way some of them attracted capital from well know investors  and funds in Silicon Valley Over the next  months we are targeting to expand our portfolio to up to  companies and expect these  companies to employ over  people over the next  yearsWhich startup features matter for potential investors At Granatus we evaluate several key factors when making an investment decision The most critical factors relate to the product the market and the team For the product we evaluate how innovative it is and whether there are sufficient barriers to entry in the form of trade secrets domain expertise IP investment etc As for the target market it is critical that the market is large scalable and can be served profitably We also evaluate whether the company has an opportunity to open an entirely new market by offering solutions that significantly enhance current customer experienceFinally we look very closely at the team  their maturity experience commitment and drive We like teams with two to three founders with complimentary skill sets who have had previous experience working together in the relevant sectorsWhich are the strong and weak aspects of Armenian startups The Armenian IT sector over the past  years has been focused primarily on outsourcing The sector currently employs about  people across  companies and represents roughly  of GDP There are a number of players who have gained significant value and experience in the sector and who are now seeking ways to move up the value chain Several companies are increasingly focused on innovation and new product development With access to capital through funds such as Granatus these companies are now better equipped to take the risk of changing their business modelsThough capital and qualified talent may be available to help mitigate the risk other challenges remain First is direct contact with the customer its important to understand your customers needs in order to develop relevant products and services  The second is the ability to scale the business and enter foreign markets These are among the key areas where Granatus adds value to its portfolio Not only do we provide investment but also our team works closely with our portfolio companies to accelerate growth and market leadership Our portfolio companies also have exclusive access to a global network of experienced advisors and mentors who serve as a source of strategic direction and new market developmentWhich markets would you recommend startups considering  The local Armenian market is small and so we encourage our startups to think globally from the outset The overall size of the market the availability of customers and the ability to serve those customers profitably are some of the key factors in determining which markets a company should targetFor example some of our companies like ggTaxi have offerings that are more suitable to local or regional markets due to the local nature of the services provided Other companies such as CodeFights and Sololearn offer globally relevant digital learning solutions and are accessible to a wide audience of users irrespective of geography Granatus is a global venture capital firm We have offices in Singapore London and Yerevan and a global advisory network that stretches from Australia to San Francisco We know the challenge entrepreneurs face when targeting foreign markets on their own and we make these valuable resources available to our companies to help execute and accelerate their market entry strategiesWhich are the current trends of the ecosystem of Armeniabased startups Establishing a robust and deep startup ecosystem is a longstanding process that requires commitment and involvement from a multitude of stakeholders including government the private sector and education Silicon Valley took over  years to become what it is today and Singapore has to date invested just over  years in building its ecosystem each are driven by a unique set of characteristics that have resulted in their success Similarly it is important for our key stakeholders to work collectively to identify where Armenia can excel and provide a competitive advantage over other ecosystems and to direct the necessary resources to the right initiatives that accelerate growth and developmentArmenia now competes globally with other ecosystems and must focus on providing bestinbreed talent infrastructure and services to startups and entrepreneurs For example while Armenias talent pool is strong it is limited in scale Initiatives such as AYB TUMO and UWC are great examples of preparing the next generation of entrepreneurs with the necessary skill sets to perform in the digital economy We also need to improve our basic infrastructure in terms of communication and transportation and develop financial and legal frameworks that ensure investor confidenceYoung entrepreneurs also need more local role models There is a limited pool of successful local Armenian IT entrepreneurs and more needs to be done to encourage them to invest time and resources across a variety of initiatives that add value to the local ecosystem This includes greater engagement with successful diaspora Armenians There are also successful individuals not necessarily from the IT sector which should be tapped for investment and expertiseWith continued engagement and investment in the right initiatives and a strong commitment from the Government to build out the infrastructure Armenia has a real chance to create a vibrant ecosystem and grow the number of startups from  to over  over the coming decade And the more success stories we can demonstrate the more others will be encouraged to invest and participate in our ecosystemNarine Daneghyan talked to Pierre Hennes Established in  Granatus Ventures is the first venture
