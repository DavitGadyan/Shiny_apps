This app downloades data from NBA official website using API.

Then logistic regression algorithm is applied to it to show insights on the most significant features for a team.

This interactive dashboard is pretty simple but it may include much more interactivity and in future I plan to add more features.

Please note that this app is deployed on shinyapps.io but due to its size and complexity of computation it does not output results fast.

Hence you may prefer to run it locally.

Nevertheless, you may access this app by the following link>>>>>>> https://davitgadyan.shinyapps.io/Projects/
